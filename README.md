# VPPSports project
This project works towards a monitoring system for technical sports. The simple architecture is that there are motes with sensors attached that forward data to the hub, which collects, caches and forwards data to the server, that in turn serves the data to the client for visualisation and analysis.


This project is part of the project "VPP Sports", VPP-IZM-Sports-2023/1-0001.
